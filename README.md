Great! Now that your backend server is running (likely inside its Docker container and accessible, for example, on `http://localhost:4000`), the next major step is to connect your **React frontend** to it and implement the client-side logic for multiplayer interaction.

Here's a breakdown of what needs to be done in your React application (`navigator-frontend`):

1.  **Install Socket.IO Client Library:** You need the client library to communicate with the Socket.IO server running on your backend.
    * Open a terminal in your `navigator-frontend` directory.
    * Run: `npm install socket.io-client`

2.  **Establish WebSocket Connection:**
    * In your main React component (`App.js` or perhaps a dedicated context/service file), you need to initiate the connection to the backend server when the application loads.
    * Use `useEffect` to manage the connection lifecycle (connect on mount, disconnect on unmount).

3.  **Implement Room Joining/Creation UI & Logic:**
    * Modify the `StartScreen` or add a new screen where the player can either:
        * Enter a Room ID to join an existing game.
        * Click a button to create a new game room.
        * Enter their desired player name.
    * When the player chooses to join or create, emit the corresponding event (`joinRoom` or `createRoom`) to the backend via the socket, sending the room ID (if joining) and player name.

4.  **Listen for Server Responses:**
    * Set up listeners (`socket.on(...)`) for responses from the server after attempting to join/create:
        * `roomCreated`: The server confirms a new room was made and sends the initial room state.
        * `joinedRoom`: The server confirms the player joined successfully and sends the current room state.
        * `error`: The server indicates an issue (e.g., room full, room not found).
    * Store the received `roomId` and the initial game/player state in your React component's state.

5.  **Emit Game Actions:**
    * Modify existing actions in your components (like `handleSelectCharacter` in `CharacterSelect.js`, or readiness buttons) to emit Socket.IO events to the server instead of (or in addition to) just updating local state. Send the `roomId` along with the action data.
    * Examples:
        * `socket.emit('selectCharacter', { roomId: currentRoomId, character: selectedChar });`
        * `socket.emit('playerReady', { roomId: currentRoomId, readyState: true });`

6.  **Listen for Game State Updates:**
    * Set up listeners for broadcasts from the server that indicate changes made by *other* players or game progression triggered by the server:
        * `gameStateUpdate`: A generic event where the server sends the entire updated room state (useful for keeping everything in sync).
        * `playerJoined`, `playerLeft`: Update the player list UI.
        * `playerSelectedCharacter`: Update the UI to show which character another player chose.
        * `playerReadinessUpdate`: Update the UI to show who is ready.
        * `startGame`, `startChallenge`, `nextLevel`, `gameEnd`: Trigger transitions in the local game flow based on server commands.
    * **Crucially:** Update your React component's state (`character`, `score`, `currentLevelIndex`, `levelState`, list of players, etc.) based on the data received from these server events. The server is now the single source of truth for the shared game state.

7.  **Adapt UI for Multiplayer:**
    * Display the current Room ID.
    * Show a list of connected players and their status (character selected, ready, score).
    * Implement "waiting" states in the UI (e.g., "Waiting for other players to select character...", "Waiting for players to finish the challenge..."). Disable action buttons until the server signals it's time to proceed.

This involves integrating the `socket.io-client` library into your React components, managing the socket connection, and replacing or augmenting your local state updates with emitting/listening to socket events.
